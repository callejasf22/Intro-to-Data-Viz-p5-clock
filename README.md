# Intro-to-Data-Viz-p5-clock
This repository contains my submission for the "Design an Abstract Clock" assignment for the Intro to DataViz class.

The inspiration for my clock is my passion for Formula One. The clock is modelled after a Driver Tracker (a view that consists of the map of the race track with dots representing the drivers driving around the track).

On my clock, the colors I chose for the "cars" on the track match the colors of 3 popular F1 teams (red for Ferrari, navy blue for Red Bulls, and orange/papaya for McLaren).

I won't describe the functioning of the clock in case you would like to assess it based on its own merits without any explanation, but further information is availble, if you would like, by clicking "Click to see details about how the clock functions."

For full disclosure, I had to do some research to create this clock, particularly for the math neccessary for its design. Most notably, I had to use the Catmull-Rom formula (this allowed me to compute points that allow for the creation of smooth curves that make up the track).

I hope you enjoy my design! Thank you for your time and consideration.







<details><summary>Click to see details about how the clock functions.</summary> I created a 24 hour clock. The dotted line on the track is the start/finish line. At this line, hour turns from 23 to 00, minute turns from 59 to 00, and second turns from 59 to 00. Thus, the line represents the start of the first quarter and the end of the last quarter. For the other quarters, the end is represented by a square on the track, which allows for a reader to guess the time within a quarter-hour accuracy. <br><br> The hour is represented by the red Ferrari car, the minute is represented by the navy blue Red Bulls car, and the second is represented by the orange/papaya car. <br><br> My favorite team is Ferrari. A little joke at the team's expense is that the Ferrari red car is the slowest car because they put up a poor and disappointing performance during this last Formula One season. The second fastest car is the navy blue Red Bulls car because they lost the (Driver's) championship to McLaren. The fastest car is the orange McLaren car because they won the (Driver's and Constructor's) championship.</details>
